Sachin Tendulkar started to play cricket at a very young age. 
Due to his bullying tendencies in school, Ajit introduced Sachin to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, in 1984. 
He was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers.
Sachin was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. 
In 1988 at the age of 15 he played for the Mumbai Ranji Trophy Team. 
In his debut match against Gujrat he scored a century and thus made a record of scoring the first class debut century at the youngest age.
