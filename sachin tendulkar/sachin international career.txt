Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar was born to bat. 
Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989. 
Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994 - 1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. 
On the day of the Hindu festival Holi, Tendulkar was told to open the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994. 
Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries. 
He was the only Indian batsman to perform in the infamous semi-final against Sri Lanka.
